# angr-Windows
Windows builds for use with angr framework

Note: Some libraries are dependent on python architecture (32/64bit). Choose the correct version.

The assumption with these wheels is that you're running a Windows system and using a virtual environment.

Setup Example:

virtualenv --python=C:\Python2.7-32bit\python.exe angr

angr\Scripts\activate

pip install <wheel file here>
